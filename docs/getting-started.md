# Getting Started — What To Do After the Workshop

You've got Claude Code installed and running. Here's how to make the most of it.

---

## Daily workflow

1. **Open your project** in VS Code
2. **Open the terminal** (`` Ctrl+` `` or View > Terminal)
3. **Start Claude** by typing `claude` and pressing Enter
4. **Ask Claude to help** with whatever you're working on

Claude remembers context within a conversation. When you start a new conversation (`/clear` or close the terminal), Claude reads `CLAUDE.md` again for project context but doesn't remember what you discussed before.

## Things to try this week

### Talk to Claude like a colleague

You don't need special syntax. Just describe what you want in plain English:

- "Read the file `report.docx` and summarize the key findings"
- "Create a new markdown file with meeting notes from today"
- "Search all files in this project for mentions of 'budget'"
- "Help me write an email to the team about the Q2 timeline"

### Use your knowledge base

Put `.md` (markdown) files in your `knowledge-base/` folder. Then ask Claude:

- "What's in my knowledge base about [topic]?"
- "Search the knowledge base for [keyword]"
- "Read the meeting notes from April 14"

The more files you add, the more useful this becomes. Think of it as Claude's memory for your project.

### Try the plugins you installed

If you installed `document-skills`:
- "Read this PDF and summarize it" (drag a PDF into VS Code or give Claude the file path)
- "Create a Word document with [content]"
- "Create an Excel spreadsheet tracking [data]"
- "Make a PowerPoint presentation about [topic]"

### Use Plan Mode for bigger tasks

Press `Shift+Tab` twice to toggle Plan Mode. In this mode, Claude plans out the steps before doing anything. Good for:
- Multi-file changes
- Tasks you want to review before executing
- Complex projects where you want to see the approach first

### Customize your CLAUDE.md

The more context you give Claude in `CLAUDE.md`, the better it performs. Add:
- Your project's specific terminology
- Folder structure explanations
- Preferred coding style or formatting
- Links to documentation
- Team conventions
